# SkeletonActionRecognition
The variety methods for recognizing the action based on the feature of human skeleton.

## TREE
> ```GRU``` : (간단한 설명)

> ```LSTM``` : (간단한 설명)

> ```Posture``` : It only look one skeleton's coordinate and inference what is current action(posture).

> ```SkeketonMHI_ObjectDetection``` : detect the Skeleton MHI and recognize the action

> ```Transformer``` : (간단한 설명)

> ```WEB```: Web UI of main model, LSTM

## Common data preprocessing
It extracts the normalized coordinates by using Mediapipe.
